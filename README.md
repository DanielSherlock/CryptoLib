CryptoLib
==========

Daniel's little collection of cryptographic and cryptanalytic tools he's written in Python

Currently rewriting it from the ground up *(-ish)*, so that it is far easier to use, and far less convoluted to add to.

**Current Status:** *pre-alpha*

**Current Features:**
 - Simple Monoalphabetic Substitution
 - Caesar Shift
 - Atbash
 - Keyword Substitution

Still contains some old files, such as PyCryptoDS.py, which is just an unorganised list of functions.
